# Getting Started

## Using THORChain

THORChain offers a suite of decentralized and permissionless services:

1. [Swapping](https://docs.thorchain.org/understanding-thorchain/roles/swapping) cross-chain between native assets, e.g. from native BTC (on the Bitcoin blockchain) to native ETH (on the Ethereum blockchain).

2. [Savings](https://docs.thorchain.org/thorchain-finance/savings) with native assets, e.g. native BTC, and earning yield paid in the same native assets.

3. [Lending](https://docs.thorchain.org/thorchain-finance/lending) out native assets, e.g. native BTC, as collateral to take out over-collateralized loans in any native assets, e.g. native BTC or native ETH.

4. Depositing native assets, e.g. native BTC, into [Liquidity Pools (LPs)](https://docs.thorchain.org/understanding-thorchain/roles/liquidity-providers) asymmetrically, to provide liquidity.

\*Of significant note is that THORChain's Savings and LP create an opportunity for holders of non-yield generating native assets (e.g. BTC, BNB) to earn a return on their investments.

\*THORChain does NOT currently support Taproot addresses (BTC, LTC or otherwise) as per the information [here](https://discord.com/channels/838986635756044328/1193894402242912356/1196456209671270491).

For all the above services, users do not need to hold (or even be aware of) the RUNE token). They just need to choose from a plethora of [Frontend User Interfaces](https://docs.thorchain.org/ecosystem#exchanges-only) (Wallets and Exchanges) to interact with THORChain. For instructions, troubleshooting and support, please contact the respective User Interfaces support channels.

## Interacting with the RUNE token

The [RUNE](https://docs.thorchain.org/understanding-thorchain/rune) token is the native asset on THORChain’s own sovereign blockchain. Users who want to hold RUNE, deposit into LPs symmetrically, and/or [bonding](https://docs.thorchain.org/understanding-thorchain/roles/node-operators) into nodes, will need a wallet which can hold native RUNE. Check here for a [list of wallets which support native RUNE](https://docs.thorchain.org/ecosystem#integrated-wallets-and-exchanges).

Users can swap for RUNE, from THORChain directly, using any of the [Frontend User Interfaces](https://docs.thorchain.org/ecosystem#exchanges-only); or acquire from supported centralized exchanges.
