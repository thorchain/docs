  mechanisms within the THORChain ecosystem

# THORChain Finance

THORChain Finance encompasses the core financial primitives that enable cross-chain liquidity and trading on the THORChain network. These mechanisms provide the foundation for decentralized finance (DeFi) operations while maintaining security and efficiency across multiple blockchain networks.

## Core Financial Primitives

### [Continuous Liquidity Pools](continuous-liquidity-pools.md)

The foundation of THORChain's AMM (Automated Market Maker) system, enabling permissionless liquidity provision and efficient asset swapping across chains without wrapped tokens.

### [Trade Assets](trade-assets.md)

A capital-efficient alternative to synthetic assets, offering 2x the efficiency for arbitrageurs with 6-second finality and no slippage redemption.

### [Secured Assets](secured-assets.md)

THORChain's approach to maintaining asset security through distributed key management and threshold signature schemes (TSS).

### [TOR](tor.md)

THORChain's native algorithmic stablecoin, designed to maintain price stability while integrating with the broader THORChain ecosystem.

### [RUNEPool](runepool.md)

Pooled liquidity provision mechanism that allows smaller RUNE holders to participate in liquidity provision with lower barriers to entry.

## Economic Model

THORChain's financial architecture is built around the **Incentive Pendulum**, which maintains a 2:1 bond-to-stake ratio ensuring network security. The native RUNE token serves four critical roles:

- **Settlement Asset**: All cross-chain swaps settle in RUNE
- **Security**: Node operators bond RUNE to participate in consensus
- **Liquidity**: Liquidity providers pair RUNE with external assets
- **Governance**: RUNE holders participate in network governance decisions

## Key Features

- **Cross-Chain Native**: Direct swaps between native assets across different blockchains
- **Permissionless**: No centralized authority controls access or operations
- **Capital Efficient**: Advanced mechanisms like Trade Assets maximize capital utilization
- **Secure**: Distributed key management protects user funds across all supported chains
- **Transparent**: All operations are verifiable on-chain

## Getting Started

Choose the primitive that best fits your needs:

- **New to DeFi**: Start with [Continuous Liquidity Pools](continuous-liquidity-pools.md)
- **Active Trader**: Explore [Trade Assets](trade-assets.md) for efficient arbitrage
- **Stability Seeker**: Learn about [TOR stablecoin](tor.md)
- **RUNE Holder**: Consider [RUNEPool](runepool.md) for passive liquidity provision
