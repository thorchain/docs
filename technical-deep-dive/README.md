# Technical Deep Dive

This section explains the core technical concepts behind THORChain. It is aimed at readers who want to go beyond the user-facing features and understand how the protocol is designed. Each topic links to a dedicated page with more detail.

## Topics

### [Protocol Innovations](protocol-innovations.md)

The main design choices that make THORChain unique, including validator selection, churning, upgrades, the Bifrost protocol, Incentive Pendulum, liquidity pools, and the swap queue.

### [Economic Model](economic-model.md)

How RUNE supply, the Incentive Pendulum, the emission schedule, and the Reserve work together to align incentives and secure the network.

### [Security](security.md)

THORChain’s multi-layered security approach, including bonded capital, validator rotation, solvency checks, and operational processes.

### [Governance](governance.md)

How THORChain handles minimal governance, including asset and chain listings, protocol upgrades, the Mimir system, and ADRs.

### [Fees](fees.md)

Overview of THORChain’s fee structures: swap fees, outbound fees, and network fees, and how they protect the network while rewarding participants.

### [THORChain Name Service](thorchain-name-service.md)

The system for human-readable cross-chain addresses, simplifying transactions without needing long cryptographic strings.
